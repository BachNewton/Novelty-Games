# TODO

- Raise slider should now allow an invalid raise. Should snap to current bet + 1.

- Raise should say "bet" if you're the first one.

- Make when your turn more visible. Maybe yellow border on your turn.

- Add credit unit to stack values

- Player actions should be in the log

- Check / Call should be dyanmic depending on current bet. And call should show how much to call.
