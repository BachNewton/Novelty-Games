# Pets Game

## Todo List

#### Things that should get done before the game is released.

- [ ] Get pet content from pet owners and add it to game
- [X] Indicate which interactions have been used and seen by the player already
- [X] Indicate the friendship level of the currently selected pet
- [X] Indicate that the friendship level is increasing after an interaction is selected
- [ ] _(optional)_ Different interactions add different amounts of friendship to the pet
- [ ] _(optional)_ Allow pets' text to have multiple pages for long messages, or add a max text length
- [X] _(optional)_ Indicate to the player that only one interaction is permitted per wake cycle
- [X] _(optional)_ Add a "welcome to the game" pop-up that explains the game and is only shown the first time the game is launched
- [ ] _(optional)_ Indicate to the player how much longer a pet might be awake or sleeping for
- [ ] _(optional)_ Add an overview page that shows:
    - Pets discoverd out of total
    - Interations seen out of total
    - Friendship level of each pet

## Content Ideas

- Pets can ask the player questions. Example: "Favorite thing to do", and the options are avaliable are only what a pet would do would do, like lie in the sun, or chase bugs.
- Pets know about each other and can talk about each other. You can learn about a different pet from the pet you're talking to. Something like a dating game.
- Pets have their own color pallet / theme, or maybe a favorite color, and the UI uses those colors when that pet is selected.
- Pet owners to provide an audio clip of their pet meowing / barking so that clip can be played in game.
- Pets have birthdays and can celebrate with the player on their birthday.
- Sleep / wake cycle can be improved so the player doesn't have to see a pet sleeping before they will wake up again. Maybe if a player has been away long enough, when they come back the sleep state can be skipped?

## Bugs / Improvements

- GPS access isn't requested until a pet that is undiscovered is selected
- Cloud save - so that the game can be played on multiple devices
- Clicking on the pet image hide the text bubble so the full image can be appreciated
