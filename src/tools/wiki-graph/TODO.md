# Wiki Graph TODO

- Progress indicator ring still doesn't resolve sometimes.
- Improved networking stats on side pannel and networking logic.
- Better force simulation or new way to arrange the graph.
- Consider fog changes, exponential decay vs exponential squared decay. Also fog density tweaks.
- Better colors and use of categories.
- Selecting a node doesn't expand if it's not already selected.
- Left click prefers links within graph and right click prefers links outside graph.
- Camera follows node as it moves.
- WASDs for movement controls.
